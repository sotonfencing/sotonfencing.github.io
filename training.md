During [term time](http://www.calendar.soton.ac.uk/semesters.html), we run a number of weekly training sessions.

### Novice training ###

**TODO: DAY at TIME, LOCATION**

This session is focussed on beginner fencers. Our coach and more experienced members will give introductory training in foil fencing, covering posture, footwork, and blade work. A typical session starts with warm up exercises or games, followed by teaching and a chance to practice by fencing both novice and experienced fencers.

These sessions for more experienced fencers are less structured, and mostly consist of free fencing in any of the three weapons.

During vacations
----------------

During vacations, our novice sessions do not run, but all fencers are welcome to attend the intermediate and advanced sessions, which typically continue (subject to room closures for University maintenance). Check [our Facebook group]({{site.links.facebook_group}}) beforehand to find out whether a session is going ahead.
