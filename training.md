All our regular training sessions are free for club members to attend, and we can provide all necessary equipment. Coaching is available for free at most sessions.

Please wear trainers and sports clothes to training sessions. Jeans should not be worn at the University sports facilities (due to [Sports and Wellbeing regulations](https://www.soton.ac.uk/sportandwellbeing/membership/termsandconditions.html)).

Taster sessions
---------------

A taster session is usually held on the weekend at the end of Freshers' Week. This year's session will be on **Saturday 30th September 2017 in the [Jubilee Sports Hall, Jubilee Sports Centre (18)][JubileeSportsHall] between 18:00 and 21:00**. Please wear trainers and sports clothes. Bringing a cold drink is recommended.

Term time sessions
------------------

During [term time](http://www.calendar.soton.ac.uk/semesters.html), we run a number of weekly training sessions.

### Novice training ###

**Saturdays from 16:30 until 18:30, in the [Old Sports Hall, Union Building (42)][OldSportsHall].**

This session is focussed on beginner fencers. Our coach and more experienced members will give introductory training in foil fencing, covering posture, footwork, and blade work. A typical session starts with warm up exercises or games, followed by teaching and a chance to practice by fencing both novice and experienced fencers.

### Intermediate and advanced sessions ###

**Mondays from 17:00 until 19:00, in The Cube, Union Building 42.**

Team training organised by the Captains; dedicated to training for matches.

**Thursdays from 17:00 until 19:00, in the [Activities Room, Union Building (42)][ActivitiesRoom].**

Free fencing, but part of the session will be given over to analysis of the week's matches. This session is generally for more experienced fencers. Due to the size constraints of the room only two pistes will be set up on the Thursday sessions, so time on piste will be limited if we have large numbers present.

**Fridays from 15:30 until 19:00, in The Cafe, Union Building 42.**

Free fencing for all in any weapon, regardless of experience.


During vacations
----------------

During vacations, our novice sessions do not run, but all fencers are welcome to attend the intermediate and advanced sessions, which typically continue (subject to room closures for University maintenance). Check [our Facebook group]({{site.links.facebook_group}}) beforehand to find out whether a session is going ahead.
