About Fencing
-------------

<span itemprop="sport">Fencing</span> never fails to conjure images of swashbuckling heroes, clashing swords as they kick furniture around (and generally do everything possible to create a massive Home Contents Insurance claim).

Or maybe you've actually tried it. In which case it probably brings to mind images of wildly-stabbing novices, shouting sabreurs, and that time the Men's Captain got chased around the hall by a Frenchman in just his boxers.

Either way, modern fencing is a sport of speed, dexterity, and tactics, and is one of only five sports to feature in every modern Olympic Games. It's a great way to improve your co-ordination, balance and flexibility, not to mention fantastic fun. So let the stabbing begin!

About the Club
--------------

<span itemprop="name">Southampton University Fencing Club</span> caters for all ability levels, from novices to those competing at the highest levels. We run several training sessions aimed at different skill groups, and we have a qualified coach to ensure that everyone gets the most from the sessions.

Our members compete in various competitions all around the country, ranging from the student-run [Warwick Novices](http://warwickfencing.com/national-novices/) and [LIUF](http://uclufencing.co.uk/liuf/) tournaments to opens and the [BUCS](http://bucs.org.uk/) championships.

We also accept non-student members, though for insurance reasons we generally do not accept members below the age of 18.

If you're aged 16 or over please get in touch with us to find out whether we can accommodate you; otherwise, we would recommend getting in touch with [Hampshire Fencing](http://www.hampshirefencing.org.uk/) to find your nearest other club.

Socials
-------

We have regular socials (including non-alcoholic socials) that take many forms, such as fancy dress, pub crawls, restaurants and film nights. Our Social Secretary will keep you informed via [the Facebook group]({{site.links.facebook_group}}), and would also like to hear your ideas for memorable socials.
