Everything you need to know about becoming a member of the Southampton University Fencing Club is listed below. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to [contact us]({{site.baseurl}}/about/#contact-us).

If you're new to Fencing, we'd recommend attending our [taster session]({{site.baseur}}/training/#taster-sessions) at the end of Freshers' Week. If Freshers' Week has passed, come along to one of our [novice training sessions]({{site.baseurl}}/training/#novice-training). Don't worry if you've missed a few sessions – we'll give you a bit more attention until you've got the hang of the basics. You'll catch up in no time!

If you're an experienced fencer already, come along to one of our [intermediate or advanced sessions]({{site.baseur}}/training/#intermediate-and-advanced-sessions).

Fees
----

You can find information about our fees on [our SUSU groups page]({{site.links.susu_group}}). Fees need to be paid via the Southampton Union Box office at https://boxoffice.susu.org/view/322/memberships.


Non-students or students at other universities will also have to be affiliate members of the Southampton University Students Union. This can be purchased at the SUSU Reception and costs about £11 for the academic year.

Guests
------

We allow guests to come to fence with us. Guests must arrange membership of Southampton University Student's Union (costs around £11 for the year) before they can fence with us due to how our insurance works. Guest fees are also detailed on [our SUSU groups page]({{site.links.susu_group}}).

Kit
---

You do not need to buy any equipment to fence with us, as we can lend you all the equipment you need at each session. If you do wish to buy your own kit, you can find information and advice on the [Equipment page]({{site.baseurl}}/equipment/).

Teams
-----

Matches take place most Wednesdays in the Autumn term and thin out a bit in the spring. Our teams are in the BUCS Western Conference, so we travel to places like Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Exeter for away matches. We're always looking for new people, so if you've got some fencing experience and are interested in being on the team then speak to the appropriate team captain. [Membership of British Fencing](http://britishfencing.com/membership/) is required for team members, and costs £30 to £40 per year.


Please come and support your teams when we have home matches! Details will be posted on [the Facebook group]({{site.links.facebook_group}}) and announced at training sessions.

We also attend a wide range of competitions, from novice competitions to international student tournaments and national championships.
